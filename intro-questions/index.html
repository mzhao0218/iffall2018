			<li>My name is Mia Zhao, my major is Communication Design, and I am a junior.</li>
			<li>I used to be a pre-med but I hated it, and art was the only other thing I knew how to do. This class is part of my Communication Design major requirements.</li>
			<li>I have a little bit of experience with HTML and CSS editing tumblr codes.</li>
			<li>I want to learn how to code better.</li>
			<li>On a screen you have to consider viewer's distance from the screen, the position they are likely to be in, and the ease and intuitiveness of interacting with web elements. The user experience becomes part of what makes a successful design, versus traditional design for paper and other similar media is more of an object-viewer relationship.</li>
			<li>I really like <a href="http://sachinteng.com">Sachin Teng's portfolio website</a> because it is simple and enjoyable to look at.</li>
			<li>I don't know if it works well but <a href="http://waneella.tumblr.com">this pixel artist's portfolio blog looks nice to me.</a></li>
