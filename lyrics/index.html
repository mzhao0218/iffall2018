		<h1><i>Lost in Thoughts All Alone</i></h1>
		<br>
		<p>You are the ocean's gray waves</p>
		<p>Destined to seek</p>
		<p>Life beyond the shore</p>
		<p>Just out of reach</p>

		<br>
		<p>Yet the waters ever change</p>
		<p>Flowing like time</p>
		<p>The path is yours to climb</p>

		<br>
		<p>In the white light</p>
		<p>A hand reaches through</p>
		<p>A double-edged blade cuts your heart in two</p>
		<p>Waking dreams fade away</p>
		<p>Embrace the brand new day</p>

		<br>
		<p>Sing with me a song</p>
		<p>Of birthrights and love</p>
		<p>The light scatters to the sky above</p>
		<p>Dawn breaks through the gloom</p>
		<p>White as a bone</p>

		<br>
		<p>Lost in thoughts, all alone</p>

		<p>You are the ocean's gray waves</p>
		<p>Destined to seek</p>
		<p>Life beyond the shore</p>
		<p>Just out of reach</p>

		<br>
		<p>Yet the waters ever change</p>
		<p>Flowing like time</p>
		<p>The path is yours to climb</p>

		<br>
		<p>Embrace the dark,</p>
		<p>You call a home.</p>
		<p>Gaze upon an empty white throne,</p>
		<p>A legacy of lies,</p>
		<p>A familiar disguise.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Sing with me a song</p>
		<p>of conquests and fates</p>
		<p>The black pillar cracks</p>
		<p>beneath its weight.</p>
		<p>Night breaks through the day</p>
		<p>Hard as a stone</p>

		<p>Lost in thoughts, all alone</p>
